class_name Rarity
extends RefCounted
## Rarity tiers and the roll that picks one. Pure — RNG and run progress are
## both injected — so the odds are assertable without playing for six minutes.
##
## Rolled PER CARD, not per level-up: a screen reading Common / Common / Epic is
## what makes the Epic land. If every card on screen were Legendary, none of
## them would feel like one.
##
## Odds shift toward the high tiers as the run progresses, so a level-30 screen
## feels different from a level-3 screen without needing more level-ups.

enum Tier { COMMON, UNCOMMON, RARE, EPIC, LEGENDARY }

const TIER_COUNT: int = 5

## Display names, indexed by Tier.
const NAMES: Array[String] = ["Common", "Uncommon", "Rare", "Epic", "Legendary"]

## The conventional rarity hues, rendered as neon so they sit inside the game's
## palette rather than fighting it. Saturation and glow scale with tier too, so
## the ladder still reads in a screenshot where animation cannot help.
const COLORS: Array[Color] = [
	Color(0.62, 0.68, 0.78),   # Common    — cool grey LED
	Color(0.45, 1.00, 0.62),   # Uncommon  — electric green
	Color(0.36, 0.68, 1.00),   # Rare      — electric blue
	Color(0.72, 0.45, 1.00),   # Epic      — neon violet
	Color(1.00, 0.78, 0.25),   # Legendary — hot gold

## Glow strength per tier, as a second channel so rarity survives a screenshot.
const GLOWS: Array[float] = [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0]

## Draw weights at the START of a run and at full progress. Every roll lerps
## between the two, so early runs are mostly Commons and late ones are not.
const EARLY: Array[float] = [62.0, 26.0, 10.0, 2.0, 0.3]
const LATE: Array[float] = [30.0, 30.0, 24.0, 12.0, 4.0]

## CARD SCREENS without a Rare-or-better before one is guaranteed. A cold streak
## that lasts a whole run is the single worst thing a random reward can do, and
## it is invisible in aggregate stats — so it gets a hard floor rather than a
## hope.
##
## Was 6, when a screen came with every level and a run had ~79 of them. Cards
## gate to every 3rd level now (M7.2), so a run has ~25 screens and 6 of them
## cold is a quarter of every decision the player makes. 4 keeps the floor at
## roughly its old wall-clock distance and still fires on only ~21% of chances,
## so it stays a safety net rather than the normal way Rares arrive.
const PITY_LIMIT: int = 4
const PITY_TIER: Tier = Tier.RARE

## Progress saturates here: past this level the odds stop improving, so a long
## endless run cannot drift into handing out Legendaries every screen.
##
## Was 30, against a run that reached ~54. The M7.2 curve reaches ~75, and
## leaving this at 30 would have saturated the whole rarity ladder 40% into the
## run — the exact failure that moved it off 8 waves in the first place. 42 holds
## the old fraction (~56% of a run's levels).
