## Pure HP logic with an invulnerability window. Time is INJECTED (callers
## pass `now`) so this is unit-testable without the scene tree or real time.

## Invulnerability that is NOT paid for by taking a hit — the dash's i-frames.
## Extends rather than overwrites, so dashing while already invulnerable can
## never SHORTEN the window a hit already bought. Time is injected here for the
## same reason it is everywhere else in this class: so it stays unit-testable.

## Cancel any running i-frame window. Note that `grant_invuln` deliberately
## cannot do this — it takes the MAX so a dash can never shorten a window a hit
## already bought — so removing one needs its own door. The only caller is
## NOGAXEH's detonation, which must not be survivable by an accident of timing.
