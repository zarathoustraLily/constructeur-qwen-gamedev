class_name Boss
extends Enemy
## THE PRISM — a hexagonal core orbited by three shards.
##
## Extends Enemy on purpose. To the rest of the game a boss must BE a very large
## enemy: the weapon's nearest-target query and the projectile's hit check both
## cast to Enemy, so anything that merely resembles one is untargetable AND
## invulnerable. (It shipped that way for one build; the boss spawned on time and
## simply could not be killed.) Inheriting means zero special cases in weapon,
## projectile, Main, the death burst, or the kill counter.
##
## EVERY attack is telegraphed — shards flare and a cue plays before anything can
## damage you. Untelegraphed damage violates BRIEF defect #4 ("a run that ends
## without the player understanding why"), which is the entire reason the boss
## exists rather than a bigger chaser.
##
## Two phases, not three. Deliberately scoped to ship finished, not ambitious.
