## every behaviour overwrites velocity from scratch each frame — an impulse

## BAKED NEON. Playtest 2026-08-03: "enemies are hard to see". They were flat
## unlit fills at 16-23px on a dark navy floor with a busy grid drawn over it —
## nothing separated a body from the background except its own hue.
##
## Real bloom is not available to fix this. `gl_compatibility` fixes the root
## viewport's backbuffer format at boot, so a WorldEnvironment on it is a PROVEN
## no-op — scenes/dev/juice_lab.gd documents the experiment, down to blowing glow
## to threshold 0 / strength 8 and getting a byte-identical frame. The only real
## post-process path is rendering the whole game through a SubViewport, which is
## a renderer migration, not a readability fix.
##
## So the glow is baked: one soft additive dot behind the body, in the body's own
## colour. Same trick `_apply_elite_rim` already uses, and it puts LIGHT around
## the shape rather than asking the shape to be brighter — which would have meant
## re-picking every tint in the colour law to solve a contrast problem.
## MEASURED, twice. The first pass at 2.3 / 0.50 with a wide falloff looked right
## on a lone enemy and turned a twenty-body pack into ONE pink smear with the
## silhouettes dissolved inside it — additive light stacks, so the denser the
## crowd the worse the readability, which is precisely backwards. A halo has to
## be tight enough that N of them overlapping still reads as N things.

## should read as mass whether the push came from a bullet or from a body check.
##

## `pixels` is the DISTANCE this should actually move a reference-sized enemy,
## not an opaque impulse. The impulse decays exponentially at KNOCKBACK_DECAY, so
