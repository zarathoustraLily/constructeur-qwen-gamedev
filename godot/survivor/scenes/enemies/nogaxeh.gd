extends Boss
## NOGAXEH — the 10:00 mirror. The only hostile hexagon in the game.
##
## For ten minutes "hexagon = me" is how the player reads the screen at a glance.
## This breaks that rule exactly once, at the climax, and the break IS the reveal:
## the shape you have been all run is standing opposite you. Its name is HEXAGON
## spelled backwards, and the HUD banner spells the word forwards before flipping
## it, so the reveal is typography rather than dialogue nobody reads mid-fight.
##
## It fights with TESSELLATION, the real reason hexagons are the bestagon: they
## tile a plane with the least perimeter for the most area. The Prism fires rings
## you weave through; Nogaxeh denies SPACE. Same shape as you, opposite verb.
##
## THE SPINE IS THE UNCANNY MIRROR, THE TEXTURE IS DREAD (playtest 2026-08-02:
## "Nogaxeh was a bit too easy... needs better attacks, more presence and
## intimidation"). Concretely: it PLANTS rather than chases, it dashes like the
## player does — with a trail — and the music thins to bass on its arrival and
## rebuilds one stem per phase.
##
## FOUR PHASES since M7.2/7.3, and NOTHING ELSE SPAWNS for the whole fight:
##   1  Two FULL 2400 HP Prisms arrive with it and it is invulnerable until both
##      are dead. Not the old half-health escorts: the thing you beat at 5:00
##      comes back as a minion at full strength, and that lands harder unweakened.
##   2  Vulnerable. Dread gives way — it starts mirroring you, dashing and
##      trailing the way you do.
##   3  Vulnerable, denser.
##   4  Four MORE full Prisms and the shield is back up. The final stretch.
##      Breaking that shield STUNS it and it begins charging an explosion.
##
## THE FINISH. The stun lasts FUSE seconds and NOGAXEH dies either way: kill it
## and it simply dies, run out the clock and it detonates first. The blast is a
## PERCENTAGE of max HP, so stacking HP cannot trivialise it — a player who
## arrives above half survives and a player who arrives hurt does not. The
## attrition of phases 2 and 3 is what makes the finale lethal, which is the
## whole reason the fight is long.
##
## Event budget: 4000 here plus six 2400 HP Prisms = 18,400. Budgeted in SECONDS
## at measured DPS, never as a ratio to the 5:00 fight — the old ESCORT_HP
## reasoned from such a ratio and produced a 22-second "climax", because the
## player's DPS quadrupled between 5:00 and 10:00.
##
## 2026-08-03: 11,200 until the 5:00 Prism doubled to 2400. The escorts are
## Prisms, so this fight grew 64% as a side effect and has NOT been re-soaked.
##
## Phase 1 -> 2 is NOT an HP threshold; it cannot be, since the boss is
## invulnerable until the escorts die. The director drives it. Phase spawns and
## escort spawns are the director's too — a boss must not reach around the only
## system allowed to create bosses. This class owns the shield STATE, the stun,
## and their tells.

## Fired when the phase-4 shield breaks and the fuse starts, and again when the
## fuse runs out. Main hangs the warning and the blast off these; the boss never
## reaches out to damage the player itself.

## Doubled and extended to four phases (M7.2). The spec's word was "double the
