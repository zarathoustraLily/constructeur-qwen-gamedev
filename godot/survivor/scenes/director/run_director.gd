## SYSTEM CONTRACT — Run Director
##
## Purpose: own the SHAPE of a run — what spawns when, when elites appear, when
##   bosses arrive, and when the run is won.
##
## Data: RunSchedule (.tres) holding Array[WaveResource] (.tres). All pacing is
##   data; this script is policy only and contains no tuning numbers.
##
## Ownership:
##   Owns:      elapsed run time, the active wave, spawn cadence, boss
##              scheduling, victory state, the intensity signal.
##   Does NOT own: how an enemy is instantiated or placed (Spawner), run stats
##              such as kills and XP (Main), or player state (Player).
##   Calls down to: Spawner.spawn().
##   Signals up: wave_changed, intensity_changed, boss_spawned, boss_defeated,
##              victory.
##
## Invariants:
##   1. Boss event i fires exactly once, in order, never before its time.
##   2. `victory` is emitted at most once per run, on the FIRST boss event
##      cleared. Continuing into endless can never revoke it.
##   3. Cadence spawns never push living enemies past Difficulty.MAX_ALIVE.
##      Bosses are scheduled rather than spawned by cadence and are exempt.
##   4. Same seed + same schedule => same spawn sequence.
##
## Failure mode: `can_spawn()` is false at the cap, with no schedule, or when no
##   wave covers the current time. A schedule with a gap degrades to "nothing
##   spawns" — never a crash, never a partially-applied wave.
##
## Done when: a full run reaches the boss and can be won; victory banks and
##   offers Restart or Continue; endless reaches the double boss.

## Emitted once, the first time a boss event is fully cleared.
signal victory(event_index: int)

## `victory` is once per run by design — continuing into endless must never be
## able to revoke it — and that had a consequence nobody had noticed: killing
## NOGAXEH produced NOTHING. No screen, no stinger, no acknowledgement that the
## player had just finished the hardest fight in the game, because `victory` had
## already fired at 5:00. The true ending hangs off this.

## The escorts are FULL-STRENGTH Prisms now (M7.2). `ESCORT_HP = 0.5` is gone,

## RATIO to the 5:00 event, arguing that 1.9x the 5:00 fight is "the ~2 minute
## climax". Measured on the first clean human run, the 5:00 event took 49s and
## the 1.9x-larger 10:00 event took **22 seconds**, because the player's DPS
## roughly quadrupled in between. A fight is budgeted in SECONDS at measured
## DPS or it is not budgeted at all.
##
## Two at the start, four more at the final phase: 6 x 2400 plus Nogaxeh's 4000
## is 18,400 base for the event. Full strength because the thing the player beat
## at 5:00 returning as a MINION only lands unweakened.
##
## 2026-08-03: that base was 11,200 until `prism.tres:max_hp` doubled to 2400 for
## the 5:00 fight. The escorts ARE Prisms, so the climax inherited the change and
## grew 64% — accepted deliberately, not overlooked, but it is UNMEASURED. The

## deleted the 5:00 boss in SEVEN seconds, while the same wall would be
## unwinnable for the stranger the prime directive is written about.
##
## Only the BOSS scales this way. Trash HP stays on the time curve — enemies that
## grow because you got stronger read as the game cheating, whereas a boss doing
## it reads as the boss rising to meet you.
##
## The 0.75 step and prism.tres's base HP are first estimates. They are meant to
## produce a ~60s fight and are expected to move after the next human playtest;
## the MECHANISM is the part that matters here, not the constant.

## The mirror event scales by LEVEL, not by weapon count, and that change was
## forced by measurement rather than argued.
##
## Weapon count was a fair proxy for DPS while weapons came from the PROFILE: a
## player either owned three or owned one, all run, and the number was known the
## instant a boss spawned. M7.3 made weapons drafted, and the proxy came apart in
## both directions at once. Soaked 2026-08-02, when the event's base was 11,200
## (six 1200 HP escorts) — the ratio between the two rows is the finding, and it
## survives the rebase; the absolute seconds do not:
##
##   blaster only, level 91 -> 11,200 HP died in **32 seconds** (target ~120)
##   four weapons, level 77 -> 36,400 HP took **212 seconds**
##
## The one-weapon player was not weak, they had spent all 30 picks on the blaster;
## the four-weapon player was not four times stronger, they had spent picks
## acquiring weapons instead of sharpening one. LEVEL sees all of that at once —
## it counts the drip, the picks, and how well the run has actually gone — and it
## is still discrete, known at spawn time, and unable to drift mid-fight.
##
## Below MIRROR_LEVEL_BASE the fight is exactly the authored base — 18,400 since
## the 2026-08-03 Prism doubling, 11,200 when the 4.5% step was fitted. Every
## level above it adds 4.5%, which against the measured ~350 DPS of a level-90
## run put the climax near the two minutes the spec asked for AT THE OLD BASE.
## The step was never re-fitted, so it is now aimed at a fight 64% larger.
