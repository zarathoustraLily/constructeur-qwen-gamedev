## The i-frames ARE the feature. A dash that only moves you quickly is a movement
## upgrade; a dash that passes THROUGH a bullet is a verb, and it is what turns a
## dense pattern from a wall into a puzzle. The window is deliberately longer
## than the travel so the dodge forgives a slightly early press.

## Separation from a BOSS, applied to the player instead of to the boss.
##
## Main's hurt-shove throws the crowd off you when you take a hit, which is what
## gives the i-frames a visible meaning. It cannot do that here: Enemy.shove
## scales by body size (KNOCKBACK_REFERENCE_SIZE / stats.size), so Nogaxeh at size
## 88 receives 13/88 of it — 11 px against a 146 px mirror dash — and Boss.take_hit
## deliberately ignores knockback anyway, because shoving a boss around would undo
## the telegraphed positioning the whole fight is read from.
##
## So the push has to come from the other side. Playtest 2026-08-03: Nogaxeh
## touched the player and "it's like he was stuck with me, couldn't get away from
## him anymore and he just killed me" — i-frames lapsing while still inside his
## body, over and over, until the run ended. That is the same "enemies just latch
## on weirdly" defect the hurt-shove was added to fix; it simply never reached
## anything boss-sized.
##
## FIRST ESTIMATE, expected to move after the next playtest: 180 px is enough to
## leave his body but deliberately NOT enough to beat a committed dash. Escaping a
## boss should still cost you the dash you earned at 5:00.
## 180 -> 260 and a grace window added, 2026-08-03. Distance alone was never the
## whole fix: the throw only fires when damage LANDS, so the boss was free to
## re-close during the i-frame window and be touching again the moment it
## lapsed. Chain-hit, over and over, which is what "he just killed me" was.
##
## The grace makes the throw mean something — you cannot be contact-damaged
## again while you are still being thrown clear. `grant_invuln` takes the MAX of
## the windows, so this can only ever extend the i-frames a hit already bought,
## never shorten them.
##
## This mattered more after the same day's balance cut: player DPS is down ~76%,
## so every boss fight is ~4x longer and offers ~4x the chances to be latched.

## FLUIDITY — VISUAL LAYER ONLY.
##
## `velocity` is assigned straight from input above and is NEVER smoothed.
## Acceleration, inertia and momentum are precisely how BRIEF defect #1 ("floaty
## or unresponsive movement") gets manufactured. Playtest 2026-08-02 confirmed the
## input model is not the problem — the complaint was "inert and boring", not
## late or slippery — so none of them appear here. Everything below acts on the
## SPRITES and cannot cost a single frame of input response.
##
## The previous version stretched the body along its travel axis. The human's
## reaction was unambiguous: "I dislike that it thins out when moving. I would
## rather it keeps its beautiful hexagonal shape." THE BODY NEVER DEFORMS. Do not
## reintroduce scale on `visual` under any circumstances.
##
## That rules out almost everything, because a hexagon cannot express motion by
## rotating either — six-fold symmetry means 60 degrees is identical to 0, so
## banking and lean are invisible on this shape. What is left is breaking the
## symmetry FROM THE INSIDE (the core lags) and drawing motion OUTSIDE the
## silhouette (the trail). Those are the two mechanisms below.

## when you stop IS the effect. A critically damped core just slides.

## version used 11 — less than half — which is not "a little bouncy", it RINGS,
## and because the core is its own sprite the whole character read as vibrating
## (playtest 2026-08-02). 24 sits just under critical: it still overshoots once
