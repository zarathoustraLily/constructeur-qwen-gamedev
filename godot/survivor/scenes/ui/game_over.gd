## Review finding 16 and BRIEF defect #4: this screen used to report time, kills
## and level, and nothing about WHY the run ended. It also never mentioned the
## player's record — the near-miss ("22s short") is the strongest restart
## motivator in the game, and it was sitting unread in MetaState the whole time.
