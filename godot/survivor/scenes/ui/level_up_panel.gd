## Cards are sized to FIT, not to their text. `custom_minimum_size` is a floor,
## not a ceiling: a long description grows the Button past it, and three grown
## cards overflowed the 640px viewport (found in playtest at level 57 — the
## third card ran off the right edge). Three defences, because any one of them
## alone still lets an unusually long word through: wrap the text, clip what
## still will not fit, and hold the row to a width that provably fits.
## Grown in M7.2/7.3: a run now offers ~25 screens instead of ~78, so a card is
## worth three times as much and gets looked at three times as hard.
## 3 * 184 + 2 * 10 = 572, inside 640 with room for the panel's own margins.

## Playtest 2026-08-02: SPACE is both DASH and `ui_accept`, and the panel grabbed
## focus the instant it appeared — so pressing dash as a level landed instantly
## picked card one, before the player could read a single word. A is the same
## button on a controller, so it is not a keyboard-only problem.
##
## Two guards, because either alone leaks. Focus is WITHHELD, so a key already
## down cannot fire `ui_accept` at all; and the handler refuses early presses, so
## a fast mouse click cannot beat the deal-in animation either. Slightly longer
## than the deal-in (3 cards x 0.07 stagger + 0.26 settle) so the last card has
## finished arriving before anything can be chosen.

## A card is COMPOSED, not a Button with newlines in its text.
##
## It used to be `"%s\n%s\n\n%s"` — name, description and rarity crammed into one
## label at one size, which is why the screen had no hierarchy and no pop. Now
## each part is its own Label with its own weight: the name reads first, the
## effect second, and the tier sits in a coloured badge along the bottom edge
## where it functions as a spine you can scan three of at a glance.
##
## Children are mouse-transparent so the Button underneath still owns every
## click, hover and focus — the card looks composed and behaves like one control.
