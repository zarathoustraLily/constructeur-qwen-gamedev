extends Control
## The meta progression screen, reached from the title.
##
## A LIST IN A SCROLLER, NOT A NODE GRAPH. The viewport is 640x360 and the
## project's own hardest-won rule is that UI gets MEASURED against that, never
## against the 1280x720 window — two reasoned layout fixes were wrong here before
## a harness produced a number. A literal branching tree with connector lines
## needs roughly 3x this height before a single node is legible, so it would have
## shipped either unreadable or scrolled in two directions at once. Rows grouped
## by cost tier give the same read — "here is the ladder, here is how far up it I
## am" — in a shape that fits.
##
## Two sections, and the second is the point: OWNED shows what the shards bought,
## LOCKED shows what they could buy and what it costs. A catalogue of things the
## player cannot have yet is the reason to play another run.

const NODES: Array[SkillNode] = SkillList.ALL
## Card colour, so a CARD node reads as a card and a STAT node reads as a stat
## before either is read as words.
