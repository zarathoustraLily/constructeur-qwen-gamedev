## The third layer of the shield indicator, after the membrane on the boss and
## the dull grey thud on blocked hits.
##
## A locked bar with an instruction, because a player watching a health bar
## refuse to move needs to be told WHY in the place they are already looking.
## Without this, "invulnerable boss" and "the game is broken" are the same
## experience, which is BRIEF defect #4.
## The shield state and the boss's NAME share one label, and they used to fight
## over it — with the shield always losing, at the only fight that has one.
## `set_boss_shielded` wrote its warning once and then latched `_shielded`, so it
## never wrote again; `flip_boss_name`'s tween fired ~0.6s later and overwrote
## the same label with NOGAXEH. The shield warning was destroyed at the exact
## moment it was needed, every single run (playtest 2026-08-03: "need indicator
## of invulnerability at the start of boss fight too").
##
## Fixed by making one function own what that label says, and having BOTH the
## flip and the shield toggle re-render through it. The reveal still plays — the
## name flip owns the label for its ~0.75s and then hands it back — so the
## sequence reads HEXAGON -> NOGAXEH -> SHIELDED, which is also the right order
## dramatically: who it is, then what to do about it.
