class_name PausePanel
extends CanvasLayer
## Pause + build sheet. Runs WHILE the tree is paused (process_mode WHEN_PAUSED),
## the same split the level-up screen uses.
##
## Exists because nothing in the run told you what you had taken. By level 30 a
## player has made thirty choices and can see none of them, which makes those
## choices feel less consequential than they were. Showing the build is the
## cheapest way to make a long run read as authored rather than accumulated.
##
## Grouped by RARITY, best first: the Legendary you pulled is the story of the
## run, so it should not sit buried alphabetically between two Commons.
##
## The build grid lives in a ScrollContainer with a FIXED height. A CenterContainer
## centres a child that is taller than the screen by overflowing it at BOTH ends,
## so at 22 upgrades the Resume/Restart/Menu row left the bottom of the viewport
## entirely — and since the keys that should have saved you were dead too (see
## `_unhandled_input`), the pause screen was a trap. Bounding the scroll area is
## what keeps the buttons on screen at any upgrade count.

## Tallest the build grid may get before it starts scrolling.
##
## Budgeted against the 640x360 VIEWPORT, not the 1280x720 window — UI lays out in
## viewport space and the canvas_items stretch scales it up afterwards. This is
## the trap the whole fix exists for, so the number is MEASURED, not reasoned:
## `scenes/dev/pause_layout_check.tscn` instantiates the real panel at 0/1/3/6/12/
## 22/38 upgrades and fails if the footer leaves the screen.
##
## Measured overhead for everything that is not the grid is ~244 px (a first pass
## estimated 199 and was wrong by 45 — fonts render taller than their nominal
## size, and the BUILD/STATS tab row later added ~22 more). That leaves ~116;
## 104 holds a margin against font-metric drift.
##
## Raising this REQUIRES re-running the harness. 150 put the footer at 364 in a
## 360 px viewport, and 125 fit the footer but left the panel itself 3px taller
## than the screen — which is why the harness now checks the whole frame.
