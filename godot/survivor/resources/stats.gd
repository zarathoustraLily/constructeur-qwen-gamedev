## Hard ceiling on XP gain. `greed` is Epic, +50%, two stacks, and both XP
## effects used to stack MULTIPLICATIVELY: with `scholar` at 3 the run held 3.0x

## Projectiles in one volley for a weapon whose authored count is `base`. Cards
## and the level drip are the same thing to a weapon; keeping them behind one
## call is what stops a new projectile source from forgetting the drip the way
## the old code forgot the multishot tax.
func volley_count(base: int) -> int:
	return maxi(1, base + projectile_bonus + drip_projectile_bonus)


## Damage for a weapon whose authored damage is `base`, before that weapon's own
## taxes. Float on purpose: the multishot and ring taxes still have to multiply
## it, and rounding here would round three times per shot instead of once.
func damage_from(base: int) -> float:
	return float(base + damage_bonus + drip_damage_bonus)


## Cooldown scale for any weapon: the cards on top of the level drip. Lower is
## faster — `fire_rate_mult` has always been a cooldown multiplier, not a rate.
##
## Floored, because fire-rate cards MULTIPLY and the M7.3 rebalance made each one
## bigger. Eleven fire-rate picks would otherwise reach a 20x rate and, at the
## bottom, a weapon firing every frame. Same shape as the crit and lifesteal
## caps: an axis that stacks needs a ceiling authored next to it, not discovered.
## 0.15 -> 0.25 (2026-08-03). The floor, not the cards, is what actually
## decided the top of this axis: the full card set multiplies out to ~0.021 and
## has been clamped here for a long time, so every fire-rate card past the
## fourth or so bought nothing. Raising the floor is therefore the honest dial —
## it moves the ceiling from 6.7x fire rate to 4.0x.

## XP effects fold into ONE additive bonus under a hard cap, rather than each
## multiplying the last. See XP_MULT_CAP.

## Hand a weapon over for the rest of this run. Idempotent — the card is
## max_stacks 1, but a duplicate must never produce a duplicate weapon.

## Damage multiplier applied to EACH projectile once multishot has widened the
## volley. Volley damage must not scale linearly with projectile count.
##
## Measured 2026-08-02: a level-45 run reached 8 projectiles (+7) AND +19 flat
## damage. Those axes multiplied — 8 x 19 against a base of 1 x 1, roughly 150x,
## before pierce, ricochet, chain and Prism Core. The 5:00 boss died in SEVEN
## seconds. No single upgrade was overtuned; the product was.
##
## Square root, so total volley damage scales with sqrt(N) rather than N: eight
## projectiles deal ~2.8x one projectile's damage, not 8x. Multishot stays a
## strong CROWD tool — more projectiles still means more bodies hit — while
## single-target DPS, which is what deletes a boss, grows far more slowly. That
## split is the whole point: it narrows the DPS gap between a first-timer and a
## maxed profile, which is what lets one boss HP number serve both.
##
## Taxed against the weapon's OWN base count, not against 1. The scattergun fires
## 5 pellets by design and its damage was authored around that; only growth the
## player bought with upgrades is taxed.
static func volley_damage_mult(base_count: int, total_count: int) -> float:
	var base: float = float(maxi(1, base_count))
	var total: float = float(maxi(1, total_count))

		return 1.0
	return sqrt(base / total)
