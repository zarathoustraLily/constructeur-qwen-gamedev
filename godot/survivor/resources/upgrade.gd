## Which tier this upgrade belongs to. The pool rolls a TIER per card and then
## picks an upgrade from it, so a tier is a design slot rather than a multiplier:
## a Rare damage upgrade is its own .tres with its own number, not a Common one
## scaled up. That way "Legendary" can mean a different EFFECT, not a bigger one.

## Times this may be taken. **0 or less means UNLIMITED** — at least one such

## Empty means always offerable. Otherwise this upgrade only enters the pool
## once that gate id is held. Two kinds of gate flow through the same field and
## the same array, because to the pool they are the same question:
##   * a MetaState unlock id — "you have ever earned this", which is what puts a
##     weapon's own draft card into the pool;
##   * a `weapon_gate()` id — "you drafted this weapon THIS RUN", which is what
##     opens that weapon's branch of upgrades. Main assembles both into one list.
@export var requires_unlock: StringName = &""


## The gate id a weapon's upgrade branch waits on. Deliberately NOT the weapon's
## own id: "unlocked the orbital, ever" and "is holding the orbital right now"
## are different questions, and conflating them is how orbital cards used to
## clutter the offers of a player who had no orbital in the run.
