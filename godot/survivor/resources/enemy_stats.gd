## One .tres per enemy type — new enemies are content, not code.

## How a type behaves.
##
## RANGED is what makes standing still stop working: playtest 2026-08-02 found
## the player could hold position all run, because every enemy walked into the
## auto-weapon's fire. CHARGE punishes the opposite habit — sitting in an open
## lane — by committing to a straight dash it cannot steer out of.
enum Behavior { CHASE, RANGED, CHARGE }

@export var id: StringName
@export var behavior: Behavior = Behavior.CHASE
@export var max_hp: int = 3
@export var speed: float = 55.0
@export var damage: int = 1

## Per-type silhouette. Null keeps the scene's default (the Drifter square).
@export var sprite: Texture2D

## Rotate the sprite to point along travel. For DIRECTIONAL silhouettes only —
## the Ram's wedge is drawn pointing up and is unreadable at any other angle. A
## shape that turns is also the cheapest possible "this one is aimed at you".
## Radially symmetric types (square, octagon, diamond) leave this false: spinning
## them would read as a bug.
##
## THE DART TURNED THIS OFF on 2026-08-03 and TURNED IT BACK ON the same day.
## Both halves are worth keeping, because the second overrules the first.
##
## OFF: playtest said "orange dart looks more like a projectile", and a 1:1 crop
## confirmed it read as a tracer round even with the glow on. The diagnosis was
## that a small pointed shape ROTATED ALONG ITS VELOCITY is the visual grammar of
## a bullet, so the fix was to stop rotating it — reserving facing for shapes
## whose rotation is a TELEGRAPH (the Ram's wind-up).
##
## ON: the next playtest reported the opposite — "darts no longer fly pointing
## towards you" — because a needle silhouette frozen at a fixed angle reads as
## BROKEN, which is worse than reading as ammunition. The diagnosis above had the
## wrong culprit: the problem was the SHAPE, not the rotation. Rotation is the
## only thing making a needle look deliberate.
##
## So the Dart faces travel again and is separated from bolts by MASS instead:
## +20% body size and +20% glow (`glow_scale`), on the reasoning that a bullet is
## small and a body is not. Radially symmetric types (square, octagon, diamond)
## still leave this false — spinning them would read as a bug.
@export var faces_travel: bool = false

## Multiplies the halo's alpha. The halo's SIZE already follows body size, so this
## is the separate axis: how brightly a type burns for its size, not how big the
## glow is. Exists for the Dart, which needs to out-read a screen full of bolts
## that share its hue — see faces_travel.
@export var glow_scale: float = 1.0

## Per-type scene, as a PATH rather than a PackedScene. Empty uses the spawner's
## default. Set this when a type needs BEHAVIOUR the shared Enemy script lacks —
## the Shard is a shrunken Prism, so it wants boss.gd, not a new archetype.
##
## A path, not a typed PackedScene, because an authoring tool that only wants to
## write numbers would otherwise have to LOAD the whole gameplay scene graph —
## and that chain reaches player.gd, which legitimately uses autoloads that do
## not exist in a `-s` tool run. Autoloads in node scripts are fine; pulling node
## scripts into a data tool is not.

## Maximum of this type alive at once. 0 = unlimited. Exists because a type can
## be fun in small numbers and miserable in a swarm.

## What this leaves behind when it dies (the Splitter). A path, for the same
## reason `scene_path` is one.

@export_group("Charge")
## CHARGE only. Telegraph, then a fast straight dash, then a recovery it cannot
## steer through — the recovery IS the counterplay. A charger that could turn
## mid-dash would be unavoidable; one that never committed would just be a
## slightly faster chaser.
